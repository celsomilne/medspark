# Overview
Welcome to our open source project for building a large language model (LLM) to assist healthcare researchers summarise relevant literature in a field.

Our goal is to create a powerful, open source tool that can help healthcare researchers ask research questions, and get literature-backed answers to those questions. Using open source models, we will build a ChatGPT-like assistant that is tuned on academic literature and publicly available datasets, to generate accurate, contextually-appropriate responses to research queries.

How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from developers, data scientists, healthcare professionals, and anyone else interested in the project. Whether you have expertise in machine learning, natural language processing, or clinical informatics, there is a role for you to play.

If you're interested in contributing, please take a look at our [Contribution Guidelines](./Contribution%20Guidelines.md). This document contains information on how to get started with the project, how to submit bug reports and feature requests, and how to make contributions to the codebase.

# Getting Started
To get started with the project, you'll need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies. We use Python 3, and we recommend using a virtual environment to manage your dependencies. Once you have a virtual environment set up, you can install the dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We have also included a data/ directory with some sample data that you can use to test the model. To run the model on this data, simply run the following command:

```
python run.py
```

This will start the model and allow you to interact with it using a simple command-line interface.
